# Scambaiting Deluxe Tools

## What's this stuff?!

This repository contains a bunch of programs aimed to assist scambaiters with trolling and/or wasting the time of scammers. (e.g. Tech Support Scams, Refund Scams, etc.)

Basically all these tools will hinder scammers from executing their script and mildly annoy them.

### **Browser Tabs Monitor (Internet Explorer Watchdog)**
#### (!) Primarily for use with Refund Scammers

The purpose of this tool is to run in the background of your Windows VM. It will periodically check if there are open Instances of the Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) and then check if the URL and/or website title is a match provided in the application settings. (Usually like a demo for an online banking service.)

If a match is found it will execute a JavaScript snippet in that Instance and by standard show a fake alert that states that the bank account is currently frozen and under investigation for suspicious fraudulent activities.

**(!!!) WORK IN PROGRESS: The tool is not yet ready for productive use.**
